# Open Muscle
Open-Source muscle contraction & detection system.

Open Muscle is designed to provide biometric machine learning training data for use in prosthetic technologies. Most problems in AI are solved using giant data sets. Open muscle aims to provide the hardware, software for a muscle contraction training data set with **target values** and/or **classification data** included.

Open Hand, Open Muscle's counterpart, is an open source finger movement somatosensor. It detects the physical movement of the fingers.

## **Roadmap**

 - [x] Create an open-source hardware forearm bracelet
 - [x] create the open-source software to acquire the training data
 - [ ] build a hand gesture detection device for data **target values**
 - [ ] Create an open-source server to store training data and negotiate connections
 - [ ] Raise awareness and ask people to help by providing training data

## Current Open Muscle Prototype V5.3.0

 - Custom PCB:  Open Muscle V5.3.0 Microcontroller: ESP32-S2 mini by Wemos v1.0.0
 - Hall Sensors: Hall Effect Sensor 49E
 - Programming Language: MicroPython
 - Sample Rate: 1200 s/s across all 12 ADCs: 100 s/s for each sensor with UDP transmission..

## Current Needs:

1. Machine Learning Engineer / Nerual network
2. Electric Engineer
3. Audio Specialist
4. Mechanical Engineer
5. Students
6. Crowd Source Data Acquisition (wear the bracelet)
