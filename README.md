## ðŸ§¬ About This Repo

This was the **original prototype** of OpenMuscle (OM12 + LASK4), developed to prove out muscle-based finger tracking using off-the-shelf parts and MicroPython.

It remains here for archival purposes and for those referencing:
- Early research and design iterations
- Press and academic mentions (42+ stars)
- Explorations in UDP-based muscle telemetry using hall effect sensors
